## Project Overview

The FoodFiesta project is designed to provide users with a seamless experience for ordering food, tracking their orders, and making payments. The project is divided into multiple features, each developed and maintained in its own branch.

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Branch:** `feature/user-authentication`
- **Description:** Implements a basic user authentication system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Users can register, log in, and access protected routes after authentication.
- **Key Components:**
  - Registration and login routes
  - Password hashing using bcrypt
  - JWT-based authentication for securing routes

### Order Tracking

- **Branch:** `feature/order-tracking`
- **Description:** Provides a feature for users to place orders, track the status of their orders, and receive updates as their orders are processed.
- **Key Components:**
  - Order placement and status tracking
  - RESTful API endpoints for managing orders
  - Status updates for orders (`Pending`, `Processing`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`)

### Payment System

- **Branch:** `feature/payment-system`
- **Description:** Integrates Stripe for handling payments. Users can create payment intents, confirm payments, and track the status of their transactions.
- **Key Components:**
  - Stripe integration for creating and confirming payment intents
  - Payment model to store and track transaction details
  - Secure handling of sensitive payment information

## Branch Structure

- **`main`:** The main branch contains the most stable version of the project with all features integrated and tested.
- **`feature/user-authentication`:** Focuses on implementing user authentication.
- **`feature/order-tracking`:** Dedicated to developing the order tracking feature.
- **`feature/payment-system`:** Contains the code for the payment processing system.

## Challenges Encountered

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered:

- **Branch Management:** Keeping each feature branch up-to-date with the latest changes from `main` was a challenge, especially when multiple features were being developed simultaneously.
- **Stripe Integration:** Understanding and correctly implementing Stripe's API for payment processing required careful reading of the documentation and handling edge cases like payment failures.
- **Database Design:** Designing the schema for order tracking and payment processing was challenging, especially in ensuring data consistency and handling potential race conditions.
- **Authentication Security:** Ensuring that the user authentication system was secure against common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and password brute-forcing, required additional attention to security best practices.
